;;; Commentary:

;; I intend to macros for tasks that I tend to repeat in this file.

;;; Code:

(defvar saved-macros-end-string "ðŸ””")
(defvar saved-macros-file-path load-file-name)

(defun saved-macros-save-macro (name)
  "Save a macro named NAME in `custom.el`."
  (interactive "SName of the macro: ")
  (kmacro-name-last-macro name)
  (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect saved-macros-file-path)
    (search-forward saved-macros-end-string)
    (forward-line -1)
    (end-of-line)
    (newline)
    (insert-kbd-macro name)
    (newline)
    (save-buffer)
    (kill-buffer)))

(fset 'org-store-article-link
   (lambda (&optional arg) "Keyboard macro." (interactive "p") (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote ([return 3 16 115 110 115 134217848 111 114 103 32 115 104 111 tab tab 115 117 98 tab return 134217790 tab tab 21 24 113 24 98 return] 0 "%d")) arg)))
