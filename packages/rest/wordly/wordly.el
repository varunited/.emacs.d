;;; Commentary:

;;
;; A library for searching Pearson and Webster's online dictionaries for
;; word definitions and word synonyms.
;;
;; Simple setup:
;; (setq wordly-pearson-consumer-key "<key from http://api.pearson.com")
;; (setq wordly-webster-thesaurus-key "<key from http://www.dictionaryapi.com/api")
;;
;;  Then, you can lookup the defintion of word at point with:
;;       M-x wordly-define-word-at-point
;;  and the synonyms for the word at point with
;;       M-x wordly-show-synonyms-for-word-at-point
;;
;; If you use `use-package`, you can do something like this:
;;
;; (use-package wordly
;;   :load-path "<path/to/wordly/>"
;;   :pin manual
;;   :bind (("C-c d" . wordly-define-word-at-point)
;;          ("C-c s" . wordly-show-synonyms-for-word-at-point))
